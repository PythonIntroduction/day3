    "## Dictionaries in Python\n",

    "Sometimes, lists aren't the best way to store data. Lists use an **integer index** to identify each value, like `my_list[0]`, `my_list[1]`, etc. This works well for ordered sequences, but what if you want to store a collection of data that isn't naturally ordered?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to store information about a person: their name, age, and city. You could use a list, but you'd have to remember that the name is at index 0, the age at index 1, and so on. This isn't very clear or readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries solve this by letting you **map one value (a key) to another (a value)**. Instead of using a number, you can use a descriptive string or another immutable data type as the key. This makes your code more readable and your data more organized. It's like a real-world dictionary where you look up a word (the key) to find its definition (the value).\n",
